My experiences in STEM have shaped my commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. As a high school student, I dreamed about botanical research the way people dream about winning the lottery. I dreamed about my life as a scientist, seeing and working with different types of plants. I didn’t pursue plant sciences until later in my academic career because when I thought about scientists, I didn’t see people of color and diverse pathways, I saw white men from academic or academic-adjacent families. This was reinforced by institutions all around me, which emphasizes the importance of representation in STEM for diversity. 

Throughout my academic career, I considered myself lucky because of the opportunities I’ve had, the most important was finding a research lab as an undergraduate. In this position, I had professors that valued my work and thought I could become a scientist which was life changing, although I convinced myself it was just luck. It has taken an incredibly long time to attribute my success to me and my work, and not luck. I learned that considering my success as luck discounts the challenges I have faced, such as holding two jobs as an undergraduate, and it has taught me an important perspective of how the opportunities I (and other underrepresented groups) received were not random but based on privilege of access and merit. Increasing diversity in STEM needs to happen at all levels but it is not possible without inclusivity. 

As a graduate student, I worked to increase diversity and inclusion in my personal and professional life through science communication and education. As a research mentor, I cultivate an inclusive lab environment by tailoring training needs and asking undergraduates about their research and coursework in order to connect them to other faculty and students. I aim to continue fostering a diverse and inclusive space in STEM by keeping a growth mindset which includes confronting past missteps and listening to all voices.
